# Route cells: direct route against copy route, recomputed from raw rows

Times are per repetition in ms: one pass for the direct route, one complete call (copy-in, kernel, copy-out) for the copy route. The route difference is direct minus copy within a repeat, as median with its 95 % rank interval; a negative value means direct access is faster. 'excludes zero' is the interval rule only: resolvability also needs the run-to-run floor from a repeat campaign.
